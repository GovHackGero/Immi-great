We plan to build a user friendly website and complemetary educational video and materials, to generate positive community sentiment about the benefits of migrants to regional Western Australian communities.

We are looking at communities with similar characteristics:

Albany,
Esperance, 
Geraldton and 
Port Hedland. 

We used ABS stat to access an experimental ABS dataset which uses 'bottom-up' business activity statement data as an alternative methodology for quantifying the value of regional economy and ABS Census data to characterise the migration profile of each regional area.  The business activity data rests on new data sources to bridge the very real data gap for quantifying regional economies.      

The need for skilled migrants in regional areas to underpin core services is well documented. We are hoping to use these two information streams to look for some insights to educate regional communities positively about the migrants they include.
